This project 2 of 2 extra credit opportunities Valerie Gadapati did for lab2:

(Not taken from the options on https://cs.dartmouth.edu/~kvasanta/cs1/lab02/index.html)
Added an educational component to the system, where clicking on a planet displays a fun fact about the planet. The fun
fact is randomly chosen from 3 options on the click. Most displayed graphics were made in Canva by me. I added image
credits where appropriate in the images themselves.
